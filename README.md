This is the *simple-Tic-Tac-Toe-Kotlin* project I made myself. 

This project shows how to planning and developing a complex program from scratch, using methods, nested lists, list comprehension, handling errors, and processing user input.

Everybody remembers this paper-and-pencil game from childhood: Tic-Tac-Toe, also known as Noughts and crosses or Xs and Os. A single mistake usually costs you the game, but thankfully it is simple enough that most players discover the best strategy quickly. Let’s program Tic-Tac-Toe and get playing!

This project does the following tasks:

* To start things off, the program needs to be able to print any state of the field. You’ll write a serious multi-line program using a lot of prints.
* Now it’s time to analyze user input and print the state of the field depending on it. You’ll learn to address specific positions in a string to achieve the required outcome.
* Now we’re going to write a fully-functioning multi-line program that responds to the user’s actions and analyzes the state of the field. Not only will it tell you who is winning, but it * * will also determine if the situation on a given field is theoretically possible!
* Tic-tac-toe is not all about analysis – a game is meant to be played! Write a program that can change the state of the field, as your first real step toward a fully-functioning game application!
* Finally! Thanks to this app, you can always challenge a friend to play a quick game of Tic-Tac-Toe!
